#+TITLE: Prolog Interpreter

* Credits

This interpreter is a fork of [[https://github.com/mfourne/prolog]], which itself is a fork
of [[https://github.com/Erdwolf/prolog]].

* Use

I've added a very primitive REPL.  To use this, create a Prolog file somewhere,
run =stack repl=, and then type =main=.

It will ask you what file to load, and after that you can type in queries.

** Sample run

First create a file with the following content.  (It is included in this repo as
=examples/syllogism.pl=

#+begin_src prolog
mortal(X) :- human(X).
human(socrates).
#+end_src

Running it will look something like this:

#+begin_src
$ stack repl

 .... lots of warning messages ....

Ok, 11 modules loaded.
